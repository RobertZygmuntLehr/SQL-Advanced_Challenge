# Building Flask API for Vacation Planning and Exploring Climate Data

## Educational
This repository is intended for educational purposes, providing a platform to practice and document data analytics and visualization skills. It contains projects and exercises designed to enhance proficiency in data analysis, visualization techniques, and related tools.

## Purpose
A climate analysis and data exploration is performed for Honolulu, Hawaii, using Python, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The analysis involves investigating precipitation and station data. A Flask API is used to provide climate-related information.

Goals:
1. __Analyze climate data:__ Use SQLAlchemy ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) queries to explore climate data, including precipitation and temperature observations.
    - . __Note:__ ORM queries use object-oriented programming concepts instead of raw SQL queries to interact with databases. SQLAlchemy is a Python library that provides an ORM system, allowing developers to use Python more intuitively with databases.  
2. __Generate visualizations:__ Use the Matplotlib Python library to visualize to visualize precipitation and temperature data patterns in plots and histograms.
3. __Develop a Flask API:__ Design API routes to retrieve climate-related information based on different queries, such as precipitation, station details, and temperature observations.

Tools/Skills Used:
- __Python:__ Programming language for data analysis and API development.
- __SQLAlchemy:__ Python library to connect to the SQLite database and perform database operations.
- __Pandas:__ Python library for data manipulation and analysis, including loading query results into DataFrames.
- __Matplotlib:__ Python library to create visualizations, such as line plots and histograms.
- __Flask:__ Python library to create a framework for creating the API and defining routes to serve climate-related data.

__Results:__ A climate analysis was performed with a functional Flask API and the results were visualized. The analysis provides insights into precipitation patterns and temperature observations, and the API enables users to retrieve specific climate data. This or a similar tool like it can be used to enhance ones' trip planning experience for a vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii.
